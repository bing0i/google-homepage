# Google Homepage
This is an assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and my first project with HTML/CSS. 
Like its name, it is only a homepage with buttons/texts linked to google things. This google-homepage project cannot search anything.
The purpose of this project is to help me understand how everything is placed on the page.

### View in browser
You can view [Courgette's google-homepage](https://bing0i.github.io/google-homepage/) in browser.
### Restriction
Footer's background of this project makes me uncomfortable. I used a trick to decorate footer. But now (after finishing pomodoro-clock
project 01/22/2020), I know how to do it right (maybe use div).
